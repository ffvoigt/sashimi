# Portugues lab lighthsheet control software

Reworked with knowledge acquired in the past 3 years.

The lightsheet software has two modes: setup and running.
In the setup mode two things need to be determined: 
1) the ranges and frequencies for lateral scanning
2) the piezo-galvo relation

In the running mode the estimated piezo-galvo relation has to be applied.
