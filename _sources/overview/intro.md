## What is Sashimi?

Sashimi is a user-friendly software for efficient control of digital scanned light sheet microscopes (DSLMs).  It provides intuitive and simple control for calibration and data acquisition while allowing the user to fully customize most of the parameters and interfacing with software for stimulus presentation.

## What is a digital scanned light sheet microscopes (DSLMs)?

A digital scanned light sheet microscope is a microscope that illuminates a fluorescent sample with a lightsheet.  This allows the camera to acquire images where a whole planed is illuminated.
A _digitally_ scanned lightshees uses a single laser beam to recreate a light sheet instead of using a 2D lightsource.
To create a lightsheet a galvanometric mirror moves hundreds of times per second (200-1000Hz) the laser beam.
