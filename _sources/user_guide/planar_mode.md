# Planar mode

The planar mode is quite simple and has only two modifiable inputs (see the [fig](sashimi-mode_planar)):

- A slider to adjust the piezo position (here the galvos will be moved off an amount which is computed using the calibration points).
- A frequency selector, that allows us to set the frequency at which we desire to acquire images.
